Many to Many is a Craft CMS plugin to enable two-way relationships from either of the entries that belong to the association. For example, if you have a recipe with many ingredients, and ingredients that belong to many recipes, you can manage the relationship from either the Recipe's entry or the Ingredient's entry.
